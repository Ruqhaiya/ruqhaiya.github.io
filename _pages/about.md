I’m Ruqhaiya Fatima Syeda, a passionate Data Scientist and former Data Engineer with a vision to make data-driven decision-making the heart of every business. With over two years of experience in building robust data pipelines, processing large datasets, and developing predictive models, I specialize in translating complex data into actionable insights.

Currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at Seattle University, I’m also a Graduate Research Assistant, working on a fascinating neuroscience project analyzing barn owls' auditory systems. My journey so far has been driven by curiosity and a love for storytelling through data.

Some of the technologies I’m proficient in include Python, SQL, Java, R, AWS, Azure, Snowflake, and MongoDB. From building scalable data solutions for leading auto insurance firms to developing machine learning models that predict human behavior, my expertise spans across industries and domains.

I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, and I’m always eager to explore new challenges that push the boundaries of data science and engineering.
