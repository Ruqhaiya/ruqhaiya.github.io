**Data Engineer**, **Data Scientist**, **Neuroscience Enthusiast**

I’m passionate about storytelling through data and making it the center of decision-making. With 2 years of experience as a Data Engineer and a strong background in Data Science, I have honed skills in data engineering, machine learning, and neuroscience research. Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Data Science and working as a Graduate Research Assistant on projects that combine my love for technology and curiosity about the brain.
