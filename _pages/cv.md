**Graduate Research Assistant @ Seattle University (_June 2024 - Present_)**
- 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗮 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 at the 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟰 𝗡𝗲𝘂𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 titled ‘A Population Model of the Lateral Shell of the Central Nucleus of the Inferior Colliculus in Barn Owls’.  
- Conducting Research on the barn owl's auditory system, analyzing 𝗻𝗲𝘂𝗿𝗼-𝗽𝗵𝘆𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 to understand their exceptional sound localization.  
- 𝗖𝗼-𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 the research paper for this project.  
- Developed ML models to predict neuronal responses with 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.  
- Extracted data from published figures, recreated visuals using matplotlib, and transformed the data for seamless analysis. 
- Applied regression techniques and SVD to analyze response properties, plotting correlations for over 120 neurons using 3D visualization. 
- Performed statistical tests like paired t-test, Anova test to ensure data reliability and make decisions.

**Software/Data Engineer @ Applied Information Sciences (_Aug 2021 – Aug 2023_)**
* Worked on building an end-to-end Data Transformation ELT Solution that handled **millions of records** of a leading auto insurance company in the USA.
* Built an Audit Framework to validate the data processed by the ELT solution.
* Developed a separate Test framework of around **(~60 unit tests)** to perform Unit Testing on the complete ELT solution.
* Built a PDF Q&A chat application using OpenAI API, Large Language Models & Semantic Kernels SDK.
* Integrated vector database Qdrant with LLMs to store vectorized data and fetch most relevant responses to the query.
* Worked on Prompt Engineering best practices and utilized them to enhance the query efficiency.
