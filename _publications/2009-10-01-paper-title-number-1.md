excerpt: 'The central nucleus of the inferior colliculus is a principal midbrain station for auditory information processing. In barn owls, the lateral shell of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICcl) plays a critical role in spatial hearing. However, responses properties of ICcl neurons are diverse and the population-level distribution of response properties and its implications for sound processing remain underexplored. To further characterize the processing of sound in the barn owl’s auditory system we constructed a comprehensive population model of the ICcl in barn owls. This involved analyzing data from multiple studies to characterize response properties across various dimensions, including frequency tuning, tuning to interaural timing and level differences, temporal dynamics, intensity tuning, and response variability. We also examined correlations between these properties to understand their collective influence on auditory processing. We constructed a spiking neuron model that produces desired responses of individual neurons along these dimensions. Our model produces the desired population responses properties observed in vivo by first sampling from the empirically measured distribution of response characteristics. Then, by generating model neurons with these responses, we created a robust population-level model that reflects the diversity and complexity of auditory responses in the barn owl’s ICcl. The analysis suggests that some of the diversity in responses is inherited from upstream areas, while other forms of diversity are due to variation in integrative properties of ICcl neurons. The developed model serves as a valuable tool for simulating and understanding the population dynamics of the ICcl in barn owls. It provides a foundation for future research into the integrative functions of the midbrain and forebrain in processing complex sounds.'

The central nucleus of the inferior colliculus is a principal midbrain station for auditory information processing. In barn owls, the lateral shell of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICcl) plays a critical role in spatial hearing. However, responses properties of ICcl neurons are diverse and the population-level distribution of response properties and its implications for sound processing remain underexplored. To further characterize the processing of sound in the barn owl’s auditory system we constructed a comprehensive population model of the ICcl in barn owls. This involved analyzing data from multiple studies to characterize response properties across various dimensions, including frequency tuning, tuning to interaural timing and level differences, temporal dynamics, intensity tuning, and response variability.
