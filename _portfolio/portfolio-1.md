title: "Predicting-Electricity-Load-in-New-Hampshire"
collection: portfolio
---
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the hourly electricity load for the New Hampshire zone. This forecast will cover the upcoming month, providing crucial insight into the fund's trading activities. To achieve this, we will analyze historical electricity load data from 2020 to 2022, focusing exclusively on New Hampshire.

### Overview
The project aims to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast the **hourly electricity load for New Hampshire** for an upcoming month. This is critical for insights into energy trading and operational decisions. The study uses data from 2020 to 2022 and employs various machine learning techniques like linear regression, KNN, and Random Forest.



### Features
1. Data Integration:
   - Combines datasets from 2020 to 2022.
   - Data cleaning and transformation to improve quality.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Comprehensive analysis to identify trends and correlations.
3. Feature Engineering:
   - Interaction terms like dry bulb and dew point.
   - Transformation of variables for linearity.
4. Modeling Techniques:
   - Linear regression, KNN, and Random Forest.
   - Custom transformations for non-linear relationships.
5. Performance Metrics:
   - Evaluates models using Mean Square Error (MSE).



### Visualization
1. Scatter Plots:
   - Visualize relationships between load and variables like dry bulb and dew point.
   - Example: Figure 9 shows the relationship between load and dry bulb.

2. Time Series Plots:
   - Load patterns over time.
   - Example: Figure 2 displays hourly load trends in New Hampshire.

3. Residual Plots:
   - Assess model performance.
   - Example: Figures 21 and 22 highlight residuals for Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

4. Boxplots:
   - Monthly and hourly load distributions.
   - Example: Figure 15 demonstrates monthly load patterns.
