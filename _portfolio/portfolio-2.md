This study employs neural networks to classify Seattle bird species using spectrograms from the Xeno-Canto Birdcall dataset. Binary and multi-class models were developed, including CNNs with dropout and batch normalization to enhance generalization. Testing on external audio files demonstrated the models' effectiveness, highlighting neural networks' suitability for bird species classification tasks.
