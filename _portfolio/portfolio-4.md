This study leverages the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to forecast youth substance consumption and the initial age of substance exposure using decision trees and ensemble models. Focusing on predictors like family engagement, educational influences, religious beliefs, and involvement in developmental group activities, this research underscores how early life experiences shape attitudes towards substance use. By integrating behavioral and environmental variables, our main aim through this study is to predict the type of substance that may be used or whether the substance would be used or not, and the age at which initial use occurs. The findings advocate for the critical role of familial and community support in mitigating risky behaviors, providing insights for targeted preventative strategies.
