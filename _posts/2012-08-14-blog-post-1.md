In this article, I will show you:

-> How to restrict users from accessing certain features in a canvas app, while other users can still see and use features.

-> How to use SharePoint action in Power Automate to authenticate a user.


## Why Restrict Access? 
In any App, thereâ€™s always more than one type of user. For example, there will be customers, staff, administrators, and so on in an event management application. An administrator will have access to everything; meanwhile, staff will have limited access. However, a customer can only access his data.

Therefore, we need to make sure that we restrict users from interacting with specific data or features. For example, using Power Automate, we can hide anything in our Canvas App from users so that they do not interact with it. But how do we know who has access to it and who does not? Through a SharePoint group!

We will create a SharePoint group and add the users who have complete access to the app, but before we move ahead, let us understand what SharePoint groups offer:

-> There are four types of SharePoint groups: Viewers, Visitors, Members, and Owners.               
-> Each group has different permission levels like view-only, read, edit and full-access.                 
-> You can assign a permission level to multiple users by simply moving them to a group.                

**Now that we know the basics let us break this article into pieces:**

1) Create a SharePoint group.                                                                          
2) Create a flow to authenticate users.                                                             
3) Create a simple canvas app.                                                                    
4) Hide elements in the canvas app using global variables.                                           
5) Bonus Tip.                                                            


###  One: Create a SharePoint Group

Apart from group names and descriptions, SharePoint allows you to choose permission levels. You can select any options based on your requirements.

After creating the group, add a user to it.

Note: Make sure this user is already present in your environment.
